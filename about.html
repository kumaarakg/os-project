  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    Our OS Simulator project is an instructional platform that aims to provide users with a thorough grasp of different operating system algorithms. Our goal with interactive simulations is to make studying these complex algorithms accessible and entertaining for all users.
    Our simulator allows users to see the execution of several OS algorithms in action. Whether it's process scheduling, memory management, file system organisation, or any other core OS idea, our platform offers step-by-step visuals to assist users understand how each algorithm works.
    
    We accompany each simulation with succinct and straightforward descriptions of the algorithms, breaking them down into major components and demonstrating how they contribute to overall system performance. We attempt to make the learning experience intuitive and interesting, ensuring that consumers understand and apply these algorithms effectively.
    One of our key objectives is to design a user-friendly interface that encourages ease of usage. The simulator's straightforward design allows users to easily move through various algorithms, allowing them to focus on the learning experience rather than technical details.
    Our OS Simulator project seeks to empower people by providing a comprehensive platform for learning about operating system principles and algorithms.
